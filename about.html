      Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses
      cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the
      common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause
      SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract
      disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or
      treat human coronavirus infections.

      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
      Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
      without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it
      causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol
      based rub frequently and not touching your face.
      The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person
      coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a
      flexed elbow).
      At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical
      trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
      findings become available. <br>
